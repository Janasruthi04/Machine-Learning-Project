Heart Disease Prediction using Gaussian Naive Bayes ðŸ©ºðŸ«€

Description:
This project focuses on predicting heart disease risk using the Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm. By analyzing medical data with feature selection and preprocessing, the model predicts the likelihood of heart disease with impressive accuracy.

Features:
â€¢	Predicts heart disease risk based on user data.
â€¢	Achieved 83% prediction accuracy on test data.
â€¢	Simple and efficient for quick assessments.

How to Use:
1.	Input your medical data into the script.
2.	The model outputs a prediction of heart disease risk.
3.	Use the result as an early warning indicator (consult a doctor for medical advice).

Technologies Used:
â€¢	Python for model development.
â€¢	scikit-learn for machine learning.
â€¢	Pandas and NumPy for data handling.

Future Enhancements:
â€¢	Deploy as a web app for easier user interaction.
â€¢	Expand the dataset for better generalization.
â€¢	Integrate with health dashboards for monitoring.
